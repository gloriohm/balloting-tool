At the last WG 14 meeting, WG 14 decided to recommend to SC 11 that the title of ISO/WD 472-3 be changed to “Plastics – Vocabulary – Part 3: Welding and thermal staking of plastics” for the following reasons a, b and c. (ISO/TC 61/SC 11/WG 14 N 12) Current title: “Plastics – Vocabulary – Part 3: Thermal joining of plastics” Proposed title: “Plastics – Vocabulary – Part 3: Welding and thermal staking of plastics” (Reasons) a. The document includes terms for solvent welding and solvent cement welding, which are carried out without the use of heat and are therefore not thermal joining processes. b. The term “thermal joining” was used rather than “welding” because the document includes terms on thermal staking, which is not a welding process. c. Adhesive bonding is excluded from this document. However, some adhesive bonding processes require heat and can therefore be classed as thermal joining processes. In other words, these reasons can be expressed as follows. (c) “thermal joining” includes hot melt adhesive bonding, which is outside the scope of WG 14. Therefore, “welding” is better than “thermal joining”. (a) “thermal joining” does not include “solvent welding” and “solvent cement welding”, whereas “welding” includes them. (b) On the other hand, “welding” does not include the terms on thermal staking. Therefore, “thermal staking” is included in the title. A CIB has been launched with the following question for members to consider: - Do you have any comments on this proposed title change? The CD consultation for this project is being conducted in parallel with this CIB.";"";""

While the result of the ballot is Confirm, we believe that withdrawing the standard is in the best interest of the committee and its stakeholders. Arguments for withdrawing the standard: ISO 4439:1979 is not a test method (as should be under ISO/TC138/SC5). The test method is given in ISO 1183-1 and ISO 1183-2.ISO 4439:1979 specifies a density for PVC-U pipe or fitting between 1,35 g/cm3 and 1,46 g/cm3. Such specification belongs to the product standard. The following product standards (European standards included) either have a requirement for the density or made the choice not to include a requirement.EN 1401-1:2019+A1:2023 (Plastics piping systems for non-pressure underground drainage and sewerage - Unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U) - Part 1: Specifications for pipes, fittings and the system) specifies a density between 1350 kg/m3 and 1600 kg/m3.ISO 4435:2003 (Plastics piping systems for non-pressure underground drainage and sewerage — Unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U)) does not specify a requirement for the density, but refers to EN 1401-1 for PVC-U recyclate (which does contain a requirement).EN-ISO 1452-2:2009 and -3:2010 (Plastics piping systems for water supply and for buried and above-ground drainage and sewerage under pressure — Unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U)) specify a density between 1350 kg/m3 and 1460 kg/m3EN-ISO 14593:2003 (Plastics piping systems for industrial applications — Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U) and chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-C) — Specifications for components and the system — Metric series) specifies 1330 kg/m3 and 1460 kg/m3EN 13476 series (Plastics piping systems for non-pressure underground drains and sewers - Structured-wall piping systems of plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE)) does not specify a requirement for the density, but it is a minimum agreed specification for PVC-U recyclate.EN 15346:2024 (Plastics - Recycled plastics - Characterization of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) recyclates) does not specify a requirement for the density, but mentions it as an optional characteristic.ISO 21138-1:2007 (Plastics piping systems for non-pressure underground drainage and sewerage — Structured-wall piping systems of unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-U), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) — Part 1: Material specifications and performance criteria for pipes, fittings and system) states a general density of 1400 kg/m3No reference to “ISO 4439” can be found in other standards, using the ISO Online Browsing Plastform (OBP) Online Browsing Platform (OBP)The standard is not used in national regulations and can therefore be relatively safely withdrawn.";"";""

Background: ISO 20083-2 (Optical Reflection Method) and 20083-3 (Elastic Vibration Method) were developed by SC 2/WG 8. Upon completion of these work items, WG 8 was disbanded by Resolution #290 at the plenary for ISO TC 8/SC 2 in 2020 as there were no remaining work items for WG 8 at that time. Currently, NP 20083-4 (Shaft Power Limitation (ShaPoLi) System) is being balloted, with a closing date of 18 March 2026. As an extension of previous projects under WG 8, it is appropriate to re-establish the original working group, should this new work item pass. By getting agreement while NP 20083-4 is being voted upon, the WG would have the ability to start work immediately after the ballot closes, if agreed upon.";"";""

The initial draft was uncontentious in itself, although there was some misapprehension as to intent.  The purpose was never to create a standard and thus be normative; the advisory aim is now clarified in the final paragraph of that Introduction.     The content has been expanded since the initial draft as matters have arisen.  Now, with helpful input from AHG members, including some minor editorial matters arising at the last CIB, I believe we have a useful reference source for all involved in work involving mechanical testing.       As has been said, the expectation is that further sections and material may be added from time to time -- there remain various topics in need of exercise, absent now through lack of time.  Feedback will always be invited, whether for implementation of any aspect or expansion and clarification.   Respectfully, Brian Darvell Convenor, ISO/TC 106/SC 2/AHG 1";"";""
