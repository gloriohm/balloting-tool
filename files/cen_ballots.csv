All TCs may give a justification for cases in which an inactive WG should not be disbanded. The results will be presented to BT for a decision on the status of the WG. The WG 4 Secretariat (BSI) requests CEN/TC 53 that WG 4 is disbanded, as there is no active work item allocated to it. When WG 4 is disbanded, BSI terminates its responsibility for the WG.

The solution is to produce an amendment to the standard allowing the use of a LED bulb and at the same time publishing a TR to explain that the new light system is statistically insignificant, so previous test results are still valid – changing the light bulb doesn’t impact the results of the test.    Regarding the identifier/number of the TR, the Secretary will look into the possbility of using CEN/TR 13823-0 in order to link it to the standard."

For product group “Fixings” (Product Group 33), which can include Post Installed Fasteners, it is likely that a CPR Aquis process will be started in some years to develop a standardization request (SReq). Document N776 informs, what is understood by the expression “Post Installed Fasteners” in this context. Document N 775 shows the presentation given by Mrs. Barbara Sorgato during the last meeting of CEN/TC 185, expressing that it can be helpful that a qualified expert group prepares input for technical requirements for Post Installed Fasteners, to support work in CPR Aquis process. This can be a starting point for definition of essential characteristics in SReq for these products. This issue is currently outside the scope of CEN/TC 185 and respective experts are not member of CEN/TC 185. Document N781 again expresses the opinion of Mrs. Sorgato and ECAP, and as well is offering to name the needed experts. On the other hand, in Document N780, the association CFE, as well representing producers of Post Installed Fasteners, expresses doubts that installing this expert group in CEN/TC 185 is the right way. Other suggestions are to leave this issue to CEN/TC 104 (concrete) or creating a new TC in CEN. So according to Decision 09/2025 taken by CEN/TC 185 (virtual meeting) on 2025-11-13, CEN/TC 185 is asked to choose one of the following options: Option A: CEN/TC 185 keeps its scope as it is and consequently the described technical preparations will need to be done outside CEN/TC 185. Option B: CEN/TC 185 expands its scope and adds “Post Installed Fasteners”. CEN/TC 185 provides the organizational framework by creating an additional new Working Group. Experts will have to be nominated by relevant stakeholders and a Convenor appointed."

The latter opens new design possibilities for building practice, which is an important further development of structural design in the light of digitisation and BIM. Figure 4-1 gives an overview of the document.   The current draft focuses on the general methodology for a numerical design of timber structures, e.g. the design methods, verification, and validation. Specific modelling information is still partly under discussion. Placeholders * and ""drafting notes"" are inserted in the document where additional information will be given.   There are still some shortcomings of the formatting of tables, etc. with the OSD tool, which was used for drafting the document. This are known and will be resolved.   The current version was drafted with the aim of covering most relevant aspects and, therefore, includes several clauses that would be better placed in EN 1990 and EN 1995-1-1 (e.g., parts of Clauses 4 and 5.1). In parallel to the Technical Specification (TS), a BackGround Report (BGR) is prepared that will be published in parallel with the TS. The BGR report will contain background information on clauses, additional modelling information, modelling examples, and benchmarks. You are welcome to indicate, whether you think that specific clauses should be rather placed in EN 1990, EN 1995-1-1, or the BGR.   The document aligns with the methods described in EN 1993-1-14, even if some terms were slightly modified for the sake of clarity. The discussions with the group drafting EN 1990, Annex I on “Numerical methods” are ongoing.   The aim is to finalise a first version of the TS until end of 2026 for vote. Due to the scale of the topic, there will still be many topic specific gaps, e.g., fatigue, that need to be closed in the following years and versions.   For this informal enquiry, we like to draw the attention to the more general aspects of the document, e.g., the design methods in Clause 4, and the verification and validation in Clause 7. You are very welcome to also comment and give input on modelling details, but please keep in mind that many details, e.g., the interaction of failure criteria in Clause 5.6.3, are still under discussion.   Unfortunately, at the moment OSD does not facilitate for a committee internal commenting such as this, and we therefore kindly ask that comments are provided using the commenting form.

The attached (draft) decision text corresponds to the e-format of the NWIP form (former Form N) which has been completed and provided by WG 5 with some slight adjustments made by the TC-Secretariat. The proposed PWI activation date is a tentative one only to comply with the CEN regulations (i.e. activation of PWI with 36 months after PWI creation).  Acceptance of the PWI demands a simple majority of CEN Members voting in favour during CIB (without counting of abstention votes). Assuming acceptance of the PWI the attached (draft) decision C 01/2026 will be forwarded to CCMC to implement the CIB outcome and to assign a PWI number to that (preliminary) project. A call for experts interested to participate to that work will be launched separately after approval of the PWI. Yours sincerely, Dr. Christian Thom, Secretary to CEN/TC 137"

To seek CEN/TC 348 approval of the parallel development of ISO/TS 41003 under the Vienna Agreement, a ballot has been made, and you are invited to vote by 2026-04-16. The standard will, if approved in both organizations, be a new member of the EN ISO 41000- and EN 15221-family of FM standards. Please note that it is proposed as a Technical Specification (TS) Justification for CEN/TC 348 possible approval of this work item under the Vienna Agreement: According to CEN/TC 348 DECISION 107 taken at the CEN/TC 348 Plenary meeting 2019-01-31, CEN/TC 348 recognizes the value in creating new standards in close cooperation with ISO/TC 267 under the Vienna Agreement. It asks the secretariat to send all approved new work items on ISO/TC 267 automatically on vote in CEN/TC 348. NOTE: To save time and because a TS do not go through a public enquiry, the CEN ballot is made in parallel with the ISO ballot and adding it to our work program will depend on ISO approval.CEN ISO/TS 41003 is proposed to support the EN ISO 41000-family and EN 15221-family of FM standards.By approval of this Work Item as a common CEN-ISO Work Item, we can participate and influence the development of the standard by commenting and voting on drafts and appointing experts to ISO/TC 267/WG 5 Human experience."
